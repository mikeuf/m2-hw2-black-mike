Issues:
1. I added a commit that was in the past tense. Before I amended it, I already pushed another commit. The git documentation recommended just leaving it rather than attempting to do a force push.
2. In tablet mode, the third image of every columns gets put on its own row. This isn't necessarily a problem, but I wondered if there is a preferred way of handling this.

Outside sources:
1. StackOverflow
2. GitHub documentation
3. Bootstrap documentation
